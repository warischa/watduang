# Verify work the way CI does

Split out of `docs/runbook.md` at the seam `CLAUDE.md` already names (ADR-0012). The runbook keeps
a pointer; everything about reproducing CI's own verdict lives here.


**Symptom:** a verification command reports "pass" or "fail" that doesn't match reality, with no
error — a calibrated gate FIRES on both the good case and the bad case · `EXIT=` comes back empty ·
`node --test` reports 2 failures on code that isn't broken.

**Cause:** the agent's shell is **zsh**, CI runs **bash**. Three differences are silent:

- `for x in $VAR` — zsh does **not** word-split an unquoted variable; the loop runs once, treating
  the whole string as a single value.
- `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` is bash-only · zsh's equivalent is `$pipestatus[1]`. Get it wrong and you get an
  empty value, not an error.
- `$?` **after a pipe** is the exit code of the last command in the pipe (e.g. `tail`), not the one
  you meant to check — `cmd | tail` then reading `$?` is always 0.

`node --test <dir>` also breaks on node 22 (it reads the dir as a module path) — `ci.yml` quotes a
glob for exactly this reason.

**Do:**

```bash
bash -c "node --test 'src/**/*.test.mjs'"   # not node --test src/tools/
bash -c 'cmd > /dev/null 2>&1; echo EXIT=$?' # catch exit directly, not through a pipe
```

**Verify a gate:** calibrate both ways — it must pass on a known-good input and fail on a known-bad
one. If the positive control fails (known-good reports broken), **the measuring tool is broken, not
the thing being measured** — throw out that whole run, don't touch the code yet.

**A gate that covers a SET must be calibrated per member, not once.** Passing both-ways on one
member proves nothing about the rest. Real case: the CI sitemap gate in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
was calibrated both ways on the `wheel` tool page and passed clean — while blind to the other three
tool pages. It covered **1 of 4**. Calibrate each member the gate is supposed to cover, or state which
ones you didn't and why.

**Three more shell traps, each reproduced on this machine before being written down:**

1. **Unquoted flag glob.** A file named `-v` sitting in a directory turns `grep -q TODO *` into
   `grep -q TODO -v file1.txt` — `-v` gets read as invert-match. Reproduced: a file that truly
   contains `TODO` reports exit `0` (found) when grepped by name, but exit `1` (not found) when
   grepped via the unquoted `*` glob — no error, just a silently flipped answer. Fix: `grep -q TODO
   ./*` (leading `./` stops a dash-prefixed name from being read as a flag) — reproduced flipping the
   exit code back to `0`.
2. **BSD `grep` has no PCRE lookahead.** This machine's real `/usr/bin/grep` (what CI and any
   fresh shell get) has no `-P` at all — `grep -P` exits `2` with `invalid option -- P`. `-E` with a
   `(?=...)` lookahead exits `2` with `repetition-operator operand invalid`. Both loud, not silent —
   but only if you're calling real grep; an interactive session can have `grep` shadowed by a
   ugrep-backed shell function that supports `-P` and won't catch this. Write POSIX ERE only when the
   check has to match what CI runs.
3. **Heredoc inside a double-quoted `bash -c "..."` expands `$?` too early.** `bash -c "false; cat
   <<EOF\nEXIT=$?\nEOF"` prints `EXIT=0` always — the **outer** shell expands `$?` while parsing the
   double-quoted argument, before the inner `false` ever runs. No error, no warning, just a wrong
   value. Reproduced side by side: the double-quoted form always prints `EXIT=0`; the single-quoted
   form (`bash -c 'false; cat <<EOF\nEXIT=$?\nEOF'`) correctly prints `EXIT=1`, because the inner
   shell — not the outer one — expands `$?` when the delimiter is unquoted. This is why the `EXIT=$?`
   idiom above is written single-quoted.

Point of traps 1 and 3: both fail **silently** — the wrong answer looks exactly like a pass, with
no exit code or error message flagging it. Run every probe with real `bash`, and don't trust "it
printed something" as proof it printed the right thing.

## Reading CI's verdict on this repo

**This section used to say `gh run list` always 404s. As of 2026-08-19 that is no longer true, and
believing it costs every session a workaround it does not need.** Measured that day, all exit 0 and
return data: `gh run list` (three runs listed), `gh api repos/warischa/watduang/actions/runs`
(`total_count` 110), `gh api repos/warischa/watduang/commits/<sha>/check-runs` (`total_count` 1), and
`gh api repos/warischa/watduang/actions/runs/<id>/jobs` (real per-step conclusions).

Why it 404'd before is not established — the 110 runs say the repo was never empty, so the earlier
reading was about the request or the token state of the day, not about the repo. Do not rebuild a
theory on it. Just try the direct call first and fall back only if it actually fails.

**Per-step outcomes** — this is the one worth knowing, because it answers "did Deploy run?" directly
instead of inferring it:

```bash
gh api "repos/warischa/watduang/actions/runs/<run-id>/jobs" \
  --jq '.jobs[0].steps[] | "\(.conclusion)  \(.name)"'
```

Used on 2026-08-19 to confirm the three deploy steps reported `skipped` on run 32269327426, and that
the OIDC login step reported `success` on run 32273450017. Prefer it over inferring the Deploy step
from `gh secret list` plus `HAS_DEPLOY_IDENTITY` in `ci.yml`.

**The workflow-scoped endpoint still works and is still the most convenient for "how did the newest
run end":**

```bash
gh api "repos/warischa/watduang/actions/workflows/333456382/runs?per_page=1" \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[0]|"\(.head_sha[0:7]) \(.status) \(.conclusion//"-")"'
```

Get the id from `gh api repos/warischa/watduang/actions/workflows --jq '.workflows[0].id'` rather than
trusting the one above — a renamed workflow file changes it.

**The trap that wastes the most time:** `/commits/<sha>/status` returns `"pending"` with an EMPTY
`.statuses[]`. That does not mean CI is running — it means no *legacy* commit statuses exist at all,
which is the normal state for an Actions-only repo. Polling it waits forever on a job that already
finished. Check `.statuses | length` before believing `.state`.

GitHub also returns intermittent `HTTP 503` on `api.github.com/graphql` (which `gh issue close` uses).
A close can fail with 503 *after* the comment posted — re-read the issue state rather than assuming
either outcome.

## Calibrating a new gate at run level

A run-level `conclusion` cannot tell a passing step from a silently no-oping one on its own. **This
section's premise was wrong** — see the correction above; `/actions/runs/<id>/jobs` does not 404, and
per-step conclusions are readable directly. Prefer reading the specific step's conclusion from the
jobs endpoint over the run-level trick below when it matters which step went red; the run-level
one-variable diff still earns its keep for proving the yaml runs and blocks at all, on a throwaway
branch:

1. `on: push` in `ci.yml` carries **no branch filter**, so any branch produces a real run. `main` never
   has to go red.
2. Push two commits whose trees are byte-identical except the deliberate break. Prove it — `git diff`
   between the two trees, excluding the break, must be empty. More than one variable and the result
   isolates nothing.
3. The break must be **type-only and runtime-inert** (a wrong annotation, never a broken call or import
   path), so that if the gate turns out to be dead, the green commit deploys something harmless.
4. Read both conclusions from the workflow-scoped runs endpoint above, then delete the branch local and
   remote.

Red on the broken head and green on the restored head proves the yaml actually runs and actually blocks
— which local calibration cannot, because a `|| true`, a bad indent, or a devDependency that never
reaches CI all pass locally. The run-level conclusion alone does **not** prove which step went red —
read the jobs endpoint (correction above) for that. Record which of the two you actually checked in
the evidence rather than letting a run-level green imply more than it earned.

Worked example: the `astro check` gate from gh#38, evidence
`docs/verification/evidence/38/06-box3-calibration.json`.
